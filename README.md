# Runge_Kutta_Algorithm
This is a C++ code file inplementing the Runge-Kutta fourth order method of computing points that are on a solution curve given some ordinary differential equation. In this code, I have programed the points for the solution curve if we assume that dy/dt = cos(2t) + sin(3t). 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope you enjoy reading my code.
